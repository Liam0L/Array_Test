# Array_Test

The application asks the user to input five numbers, each between 10 and 100 (inclusive). As each number is read, it is displayed only if it is not a duplicate of a number already read. Displays the complete set of unique values input after the user inputs each new value.

This is a test program for dealing with arrays in Java and also using the 'Set' collection class to achieve the same result.
